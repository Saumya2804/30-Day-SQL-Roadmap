# 30-Day SQL Roadmap 

Welcome to my **30-Day SQL Roadmap** repository! üåü

This repo contains **daily SQL exercises, practice queries, and projects** as part of my 30-day journey to **brush up and master SQL skills**. Each day is designed to build on the previous, starting from SQL foundations to advanced concepts, optimization, and project work.

I am sharing **queries, practice problems, and mini-projects** here to document my learning journey. You can also follow along and try the exercises yourself!
